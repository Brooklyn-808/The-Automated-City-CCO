The Automation City
-
Prologue: (from a anonymous hacker/collator, 808)
-
We don't usually notice them do we... We tell stories of the living in the city, but we forget the living city... Robots are all around us... When the age of industrialization hit us, our world was flipped, in which mass production came into power... When the age of information hit, a lot happened... Information became so widely available, communication borders covered the globe and an ancient form of The Network came to be: The Internet... Then, a few decades ago, the age of intelligence arrived... AI became widely used, we use neural interfaces to connect to The Network, we became Netrunners but most importantly, physical labor wasn't necessary for humans anymore... This collation of logs will tell us stories of our own but not from our own... For we need to remember, the walls have eyes and the floors have ears, we should hear from the omnipresent beings in our lives... From the AI...
